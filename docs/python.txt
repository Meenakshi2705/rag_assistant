Python is a high-level programming language created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It emphasizes code readability and uses significant indentation. 

Key Features:
- Interpreted: No compilation needed; runs directly.
- Dynamically typed: No need to declare variable types.
- Versatile: Used for web development (Django, Flask), data science (Pandas, NumPy), AI (TensorFlow, PyTorch), and scripting.

Popular Tools:
- Jupyter Notebooks: Interactive coding environment.
- Pip: Package installer for Python libraries.
- Virtualenv: Isolated Python environments.

Example Code:
print("Hello, World!")
